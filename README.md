# AirBnB_Listings_2016_Dashboard

## Project Overview
- Created an interactive dashboard with [Tableau Public](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) with dataset that
contains the AirBnB listing of all house sales in Seattle 2016.
- The case of this project is “Your working for a client that wants to start an
AirBnB business. So, you want to find out where to buy a house to put in
AirBnB and to rent it out, where’s the best location for it, and what other
factors should be considered.
- Insights:
  - Zip code (areas) in Seattle where the AirBnB can charge the most
based on its average price.
  - We can see from the Revenue by 2016 graph, that revenues are low
because there’s not a lot of people travelling in the beginning of
January 2016. But in Summer and holidays in the end of the year, a lot
of people are travelling and that’s when revenues are high.
  - From the Average Price by Bedrooms, we can say that AirBnB’s with 1
bedroom are not generating enough profit but maybe low cost in front.
In the other hand, AirBnB’s with more bedrooms will generate a higher
return.
  - From the Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings, we can acknowledge that
there’s a high competition for listings with 1 bedroom, and the more
bedrooms the lower the competition.
